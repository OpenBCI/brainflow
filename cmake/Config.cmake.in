# in theory with lines above you can write smth like:
# target_link_libraries (target brainflow::GetData brainflow::BoardController)
# directly in dependend package CMakeLists.txt after find_package
# but it doesn't link libraries so it leads to linking error and I have no idea why
# workaround - set variables for include and library path and use these variables in package consumer code
